# autoGrocer

In these trying times, the elderly have been hit particularly hard. While normality is still far away, we can begin to build solutions that might help facilitate lockdown life. An area that desperately needs such solutions is online grocery shopping. Tons of new sites have popped up during the pandemic, but the inconsistent and often confusing user interfaces cause difficulties for the elderly and tech illiterate.

This is where autoGrocer comes in. Rather than asking for a user to change their entire grocery shopping routine, autoGrocer allows for a pain-free online shopping interface. All a user has to do is open the app, snap a picture of their paper grocery list, and sit back as autoGrocer adds all items in the list to a cart in the indicated quantities. Because autoGrocer is equipped with the powerful Google vision API for text detection, handwritten grocery lists are recognized accurately and consistently. After autoGrocer is done processing the request, it sends an email to the user with their order!
